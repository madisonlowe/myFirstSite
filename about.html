      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="feature-text">
        Iâ€™m a full-stack software developer, based in the North of England. I
        like making things and solving problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having previously studied English Literature, and worked in retail,
        telemarketing and customer service, I decided to pursue a new career
        path. I wanted to be able to work creatively, create robust solutions to
        problems, and engage fresh opportunities for learning and personal
        growth. Iâ€™ve always been interested in technology, and knew that
        software development would allow me to do just that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got stuck in, completing the SheCodes Basics Introduction to Coding
        and freeCodeCampâ€™s Responsive Web Design certifications. This led me to
        apply to the School of Code, where I was ultimately selected as one of
        150 students â€“ out of nearly 3000 applicants â€“ to train full-time for 16
        weeks in software development.
