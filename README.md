# Building My Website

This is a repo tracking the development process of researching, planning, building, and rebuilding my personal website! I will update this document once the site is properly deployed, but for now, I'm going to be tracking my design and build progress and keeping notes.

The task at hand is to create a website about me, which will be viewed by employers and other developers primarily, and should serve as a kind of coding portfolio website first and foremost. Don't forget to keep in mind the design thinking principles! Empathise, define, ideate, prototype, and test.

### **Empathising, Defining, & Researching**

Early stage planning has been completed and documented in **[this Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1k15eMy4CZk1_8h_eVONCJmqYfkn6IVc8dLzSqgx80C0/edit?usp=sharing).**

- **Jamboard.** Who will be using my website? What will they be looking for? What needs should this website fulfill? ✅
- **User stories and personas.** Define my users' needs and problems. ✅
- Maybe create a **user flow** diagram on draw.io. ✅

### **Ideating & Low-fidelity Wireframes**

Low-fidelity wireframes have been completed in **[this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO0jzscM=/?share_link_id=378879754284).**

- Remember Paavan's emphasis: UX should be about storytelling, attention, and wonder.
- **Inspiration board.** Collate the information and look for design elements that will match the energy and vibe I want to reflect. Looking specifically for information on shapes and layout, but also consider that I will be a user of my own product. What do I want to convey? It is a product that will speak for me, what do I want it to say? ✅
- **Low fidelity wireframes.** Create these in Miro, drawing on research into other portfolios and websites. ✅
  - (If you went into UX/UI, you could call your website _lowefidelity_, teehee).

### **Prototyping & High-fidelity Wireframes**

High-fidelity wireframe can be viewed **[on Figma here](https://www.figma.com/proto/VjKqj0v019CX4fdlSRjErL/W3-Hifi-Wireframe?node-id=9%3A63&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=9%3A63).**

- As close to end product as possible. ✅
- Use **Figma** in order to accomplish this. ✅
- Refer to sites like **Typewolf** in order to get some ideas of different typography and colour elements you like. ✅
- Collate palettes and typography ideas before beginning. ✅

### **Coding, Testing & Re-ideating**

- Refactoring ideas: wanted to add raindrops and natural shapes to the CSS shapes!
- Notes from coding: responsive sizing on the colour blobs on my hi-fi wireframes, if they're made out of CSS, was a lot of work and effort to figure out. So, I put that element of the design on the backburner, and experimented with centralising another design idea I'd really enjoyed instead, which was the rotating-on-click self-descriptors. Beginning of code will be saved in a folder in this repo.
